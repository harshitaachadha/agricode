Research project to study the impact of novel clustering based WBAN protocol in the real world. 

Wireless sensor networks are one of the most widely explored technologies in recent years. With advances in the capabilities of smart sensors, the utility of these networks is at an all-time high. One field where this industry is capable of making a huge positive economic and ecological impact is the agriculture industry; more specifically irrigation methodologies and the ensuing water usage. Since water conservation has become a top priority with projections indicating that about 70-80% of the total world water consumption is in the agriculture sector, increasing efforts are being made to find solutions for this problem. In this article, the utility of the application of sensor networks in the reduction of irrigation water consumption is explored. The results of the study are promising and indicative of an approximately 38% reduction in water consumption.
